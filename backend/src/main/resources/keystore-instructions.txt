# Instructions for Creating a Self-Signed Certificate

To create a self-signed certificate for HTTPS development, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt
2. Navigate to the resources directory of the project
3. Run the following command:

```
keytool -genkeypair -alias tomcat -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore keystore.p12 -validity 3650 -storepass changeit
```

4. When prompted, provide the following information:
   - For "first and last name", enter "localhost" (this helps avoid certificate warnings)
   - For other fields, you can provide your own information or press Enter to skip

5. Verify the certificate was created by checking for the keystore.p12 file in the resources directory

6. The application is already configured to use this keystore with the default password "changeit"

Note: For production environments, you should obtain a proper SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.
